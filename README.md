## Consumer Survey Report: Marketing Mix for a Hypothetical Product
This project was a group assignment for our Marketing class, completed by a team of four students. The project aimed to analyze consumer preferences and behaviors to develop a strategic marketing mix for a hypothetical product (PetPal). As part of the group, I handled the data analysis segment, which included processing, visualizing, and interpreting the survey data to derive actionable insights.
